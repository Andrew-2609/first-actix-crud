# Simple Tasks CRUD with Actix Web Framework

This is a very very simple CRUD I built using the Actix Web Framework for the REST API and PostgreSQL as the database.

It's not a big deal, really. The project was built based on this tutorial: [Build a CRUD REST API with Rust Axum | Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NJsTgmayHZY), and I took the opportunity to refactor the code a bit in my own way, to avoid code repetition and also explore Ruts's core concepts a little more. Thanks a lot for visiting this repo!
